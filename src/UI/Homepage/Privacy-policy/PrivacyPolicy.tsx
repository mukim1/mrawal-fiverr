          </h2>
          , in which we provide you with regular information about innovations
          to our products and campaigns. Subscribing to our newsletters utilises
          the double opt-in procedure, i.e. we will only send you newsletters by
          email if you confirm, by clicking on a link in our notification email,
          that you are the owner of the specified email address. If you confirm
          your email address, we will store your email address, the time of
          sign-up, and the IP address used during the sign-up process until such
          time as you unsubscribe from the newsletters. The sole purpose of this
          storage is to send you the newsletters and be able to prove that you
          signed up to receive them. You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at
          any time. Each newsletter contains an unsubscribe link. Alternatively,
          you can of course also simply send a message using the contact details
          given above or in the newsletter (e.g. by email or letter). The legal
          basis for this processing is your consent as per Article 6(1)(a) of
          the GDPR. In our newsletters we use commercially available
          technologies to measure interactions with the newsletters (e.g.
          opening of the email, clicked links). We use this data in pseudonymous
          form for general statistical evaluations as well as for the optimising
          and further development of our content and customer communication.
          This is done with the help of small graphical elements embedded in our
          newsletters (pixels). The data is collected on a pseudonymised basis
          only and is not associated with any of your other personal data. The
          legal basis for this is our above-mentioned legitimate interest as per
          Article 6(1)(1)(f) of the GDPR. We want to use our newsletter to share
          content of maximum relevance to our customers and to better understand
          what readers are actually interested in. If you do not want us to
          analyse your usage patterns, you can unsubscribe from the newsletter
          or generally deactivate graphics in your email client. Data relating
          to interaction with our newsletters is stored in pseudonymised form
          for 30 days and then fully anonymised.

          use finAPI, a service provided by finAPI GmbH, Adams-Lehmann-Str. 44,
          80797 Munich, Germany. In order to be able to offer online banking
          directly as a software provider, a provider must be in possession of a
          banking licence from BaFin, the German Federal Financial Supervisory
          Authority. We therefore carry out online banking using the service
          provider finAPI. finAPI is a fintech company with a BaFin licence. All
          transactions using online banking within Lano are handled by finAPI.
          finAPI is responsible for communication with the bank and then
          transmits to Lano the account statements or transaction information
          after the payment (e.g. bank transfer) has been completed. A
          transaction number (TAN) must be entered during all processes that
          initiate payments (bank transfers or direct debits). You must type in
          this number whenever you initiate a transaction. Neither Lano nor
          finAPI store TANs on any servers – they are used solely to execute the
          transaction. Lano itself, as well as the interface to finAPI, uses TLS
          3.0 and 256-bit encryption. This is the same standard of security
          used, for example, in normal internet banking. The legal basis is
          Article 6(1)(b) GDPR, in order to fulfill the payment under a contract
          with you, and otherwise Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, whereby the use of an
          external payment service provider is based on our legitimate interest
          in being able to offer you a convenient payment option. You can find
